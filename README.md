- 👋 Hello, I’m Athanasios Konstantakopoulos. I have a BSc in Physics from the University of Patras, Greece and I am currently a graduate student at the Department
     of Computer Engineering and Informatics of the same University, pursuing a Master's Degree in "Information Processing and Machine Intelligence".
       
- 👨‍💻 "I have a keen interest in all things related to Science and Technology (definitely a nerd 🤓!), with a particular focus on Data Science, Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning."
  
- 🛫 I am currently focused on my Master's thesis, working on the problem of UAV visual localization. I also work as a teacher, instructing various STEM subjects.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that i find interesting!.
  
- 📫 You can contact me through Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/athanasios-konstantakopoulos

- ⚡ Fun facts: I like fast cars, expensive watches, unhealthy food and my sense of humour is darker than the protagonist of Netflix's latest remake. Also, I nearly failed to pass the entrance exams for the Department of Physics.
  However, I graduated in the top 10% of my class!
